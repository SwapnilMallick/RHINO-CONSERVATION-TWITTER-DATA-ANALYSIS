# RHINO-CONSERVATION-TWITTER-DATA-ANALYSIS

This study addresses the complex issue of illegal wildlife trade, focusing on rhino poaching and its profound impact on global biodiversity. Our research leverages
the power of social media data to gauge public sentiment and identify trends in rhino conservation efforts. We analyzed a dataset comprising over 19 million
tweets, with a focus on English-language content related to rhino conservation. Various toolkits, including Pattern, TextBlob, VADER, and Twitter-roBERTa-base, were utilized to gauge the sentiment expressed in the tweets. In parallel, topic modeling techniques such as LDA and BTM were applied to gain deeper insights into the prevalent discussion topics and identify the user categories participating in these conversations. These methodologies yielded satisfactory outcomes, providing valuable insights into the critical aspects of rhino conservation
discussions on Twitter. Furthermore, this study shed light on the extent to which pre-trained natural language processing tools can be relied upon to draw conclusions about conservation related issues.
